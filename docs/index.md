# Continuum Architecture Manifesto

> “An application is not an object. It is an act.”  
>  
> The Continuum Architecture redefines what an application truly is:  
> the dynamic orchestration of a domain within a context to solve a real-world problem.

## About

This repository contains the official **Continuum Architecture Manifesto**, a foundational text that proposes a new way of thinking about software architecture.

It restores the central role of **context**, questions our assumptions about what an “application” is, and offers a universal yet adaptive model based on the idea of a **continuum** between domain and context.

It is intended as a **vision**, a **framework of thought**, and a **philosophical foundation** for how we structure, build, and evolve our systems.

## Read the Manifesto

Available in:

## From Theory to Practice

The Continuum Architecture is, by design, independent of any specific technology, language, or framework.

However, it is meant to inspire real-world systems — and several implementations aligned with its principles are currently underway.

If you’re working on your own interpretation or implementation, we encourage you to share it.

> The manifesto is the foundation.  
> The rest is yet to be built — together.

## Acknowledgement

This manifesto is not a final answer — it is an invitation.  
An invitation to rethink what we build, why we build, and how we bring meaning into our code.

> Architecture is the art of orchestrating a domain in a context — not just the structure of files.  
> The continuum is where the real application lives.
