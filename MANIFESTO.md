## 1\. Preamble — An Industry in Need of Rethinking

For decades, the software industry has moved at high speed, propelled by dazzling technological advances.  
But in this race for performance, innovation, and scalability, one fundamental element has been pushed into the shadows: **context**.

We’ve been taught to think in terms of “business domains,” “logic,” “entities,” and “behaviors” — as if these could exist in the absolute, independent of their environment.  
We’ve modeled the world through rigid abstractions, often frozen in place, without sufficiently questioning the frame in which these abstractions come to life.  
We’ve built architectures that claim to be universal, but fall apart as soon as they encounter concrete variation: platform shifts, changing requirements, deployment migrations, evolving usage patterns.

Too often, we confuse **code** with **application**.  
But an application is not a collection of files.  
It is not a framework. It is not a server or an interface.

> An application is an **act** — the act of applying a skill or expertise (the domain) to a concrete situation (the context), in order to resolve a real problem.

From this restored definition, the term “application” will be used throughout this manifesto in its original, intentional sense.

To refer to what the industry has traditionally called an “application” — a collection of files, a program, an interface, a backend or frontend — we will now use the term **software system**, or simply **system** for short.

> **An application is an act.**  
> **A system is what enables its execution.**

It is from this realization that the Continuum Architecture was born.  
It offers a direct response to a series of systemic dysfunctions:

- An approach too centered on the domain, unable to gracefully adapt to the diversity of contexts;
- An over-engineering that confuses structure with rigidity, and sanctifies frozen models;
- An industry that favors abstract generality over concrete specificity,  
and fixed universality over contextualized usage.

We believe it’s time to redefine what we mean by **application**.  
We believe it’s time to restore **context** to its rightful place as a first-class actor in software design.  
We believe the future of software architecture lies in a deep understanding of the relationship between **domain and context**, in their fluid, adaptive interplay — in what we call the **continuum**.

This manifesto lays the foundation for that vision.

## 2\. Defining the Foundations — Domain, Context, Application

### Domain

The **domain** is the **digitization of a business need**—be it operational, organizational, economic, or social.  
It embodies business logic, meaning the way a human activity—selling, caring, organizing, learning, interacting—can be **represented and automated** within a computer system.

It encompasses rules, processes, data structures, decisions, expected behaviors—everything defining **what an application must do to fulfill a business objective**.

The domain is **abstract by nature**: it is neither bound to a technology nor to an execution environment. It **models an expertise we wish** to operationalize through software.

Yet this expertise alone **means nothing**. It only becomes real when a**pplied to a context**.

> The domain is the answer to a need.  
> The context is the situation in which this answer comes alive.

### Context

**Context** is more than an execution environment. It is **what gives meaning**.

The same piece of information, the same action, the same behavior can hold radically different meanings depending on the context in which it appears.  
A word, a gesture, data, source code: **it is not their intrinsic nature that matters, but the frame within which they are situated**.

> **Context transforms data into information**, rules into decisions, functions into applications.  
> A simple sentence like "It’s raining" only makes sense if we know where, when, and for whom.  
> In computing, an instruction like `x = 5` is merely isolated bytes until we know in which program, at what moment, and for what purpose it is being used.

In a software system, context refers to the **actual situation** in which the domain operates.

It includes:

- **Channels** (web, mobile, API, CLI…)
- **Runtime** environments (browser, server, edge, cloud…)
- **Users** (their needs, roles, culture)
- **Technical** **constraints** (latency, security, scalability…)
- **External integrations** (databases, services, sensors…)
- And every element **capable of altering the meaning and use of the domain.**

Context is **inherently unstable**, often partially known, sometimes unpredictable. Yet, **it determines what needs to be done, how, and why.**

The domain gains operational reality **only within a given context.**  
Without context, business logic remains theoretical, **abstract, inactive.**  
This is why, in Continuum Architecture, context is not a secondary parameter—**it is a first-class citizen.**

### Application

The word **application** derives from the Latin *applicatio*, from the verb *applicāre*, meaning:  
"**to bring into contact, to place near, to apply upon.**"

This original meaning is essential. It reveals a truth too often forgotten by the software industry:

> An application is not an object but a **movement**, a **fundamental gesture**: **placing a domain in contact with a context.**

Thus, the true question to ask is not "*what is an application?*" but rather "**what is being brought into contact?**"  
And the answer is straightforward: **the domain and the context.**

An **application** is the act of applying **structured knowledge (the domain)** to a **real-world situation (the context)** with the goal of solving a problem.

> **Application = Domain × Context → Resolution**

This gesture renders both entities **inseparable**:

- The domain has **no value** without a context to receive it.
- The context has **no structure** without a domain to inhabit it.

This is the very definition of a **continuum**:  
A blurred boundary, constant interaction, **functional interdependence.**

An application does not "bring into existence" a domain; **it offers it a space to express itself.**  
It does not merely execute code: **it stages a relationship**, with all the subtlety, temporality, and adaptability this implies.

A **good software architecture** is precisely this:

> **A successful staging of the encounter between domain and context.**  
> It orchestrates this encounter across all dimensions:

- **Technical** (infrastructure, languages, protocols)
- **Human** (users, roles, accessibility)
- **Temporal** (synchronization, latency, lifespan)
- **Economic** (cost, profitability, value)

This vision is the essence of **Continuum Architecture.**  
We no longer conceive of closed software objects, but of **orchestrated, living, and situated relationships.**  
This, truly, is what it means to **design an application.**

## 3\. Rehabilitating Context

**Context** is undoubtedly **one of the great absentees of contemporary software architecture.**

For years, we’ve built solid domain models, well-encapsulated services, neatly typed pipelines… but **rarely explicit models of context.**  
We relegated it to the system’s periphery, treated it as an execution detail, an environment variable, a shifting backdrop to which we adapt “on the fly.”

> Yet it is context that determines the meaning, the scope, the feasibility, and even the value of a domain.

Continuum Architecture proposes to **rethink context** by structuring it along two complementary axes:

- **External context**: everything **outside the application**—platform, users, events, requests, databases, third-party services.
- **Internal context**: what is **modeled within the application**—the referential space in which the domain expresses itself, reasons, and acts.

**External context** is raw, variable, uncertain, shaped by forces over which the application has no control.

> You can’t stop the rain from falling, but you can carry an umbrella.  
> Architecture cannot force the environment to conform to it. It must **understand** it, **welcome** it, and **abstract from it intelligently.**

This is where the **integration dimension** comes into play—**the medium between internal and external context.**  
It is embodied by an **adapter, aware of both contexts**, that transforms an external input into an **intention**.

> **Intention** is the **expressed form of need**: it represents what the actor expects from the application, in a language the system can interpret.

The adapter **normalizes the intention** and passes it on to the **initialization dimension**, which alone is responsible for orchestrating the domain’s execution.

In Continuum Architecture, the internal context is structured along **three fundamental dimensions:**

1. **The Setup Dimension**This is the foundational layer.  
Its role is to **construct a blueprint of the application**—a unified representation of all its internal elements: modules, services, configurations, dependencies—whether defined by the user (developer) or derived from third-party libraries.  
This blueprint can be built **declaratively (through introspection) or manually**, and forms the **registry** for all components necessary to the application’s lifecycle.
2. **The Integration Dimension**This is the **point of contact with the outside world.**  
It captures inputs from the external context (events, requests, signals), **translates them into intentions**, and passes them on to the next step in the application process.  
It is the **gateway for intention**—but **it does not directly trigger domain execution.**
3. **The Initialization Dimension**This is the **operational core of the application.**  
Here, **the domain is loaded, prepared, activated, based** on the **blueprint** and the received **intention**.  
At this level, **internal context truly intersects with the domain**—where functionality comes to life, business logic is instantiated, and the need is fulfilled.

> This three-dimensional model **renders the internal context visible, structured, and controllable**, while **maintaining a strong separation from the external context**—ensuring functional and intentional continuity.

To rehabilitate context is not merely to “take it into account.”  
It is **to model it as a living entity**, with its flows, its forms, its tensions—and to make software architecture **the art of orchestrating this complexity** with lucidity, elegance, and adaptability.

## 4\. The Role of the Domain in the Continuum

In Continuum Architecture, the **domain** is not marginalized — it is **repositioned**.

For years, most efforts in software architecture have focused on **structuring the domain**:

- Clean Architecture
- DDD (Domain-Driven Design)
- Onion, Hexagonal, Ports & Adapters…

And rightly so. These approaches have **laid solid foundations**, especially in terms of:

- Separation of concerns
- Isolation of business logic
- Testability
- Ubiquitous language

We have **no reason to reject them**.  
On the contrary: Continuum Architecture **acknowledges their value** and builds upon them.

But it adds one essential insight:

The domain does not operate in a vacuum.

**The Domain Facing Uncertainty**

It is often said that the domain should “know nothing of the context,” even that it should “completely ignore it.”  
But this idea, taken to the extreme, leads to a logical dead end:

> **How can a domain execute in an environment of which it knows neither the structure, nor the intentions, nor the constraints?**  
> **How can it transform an intention into a response if we pretend that the intention comes from nowhere?**

Continuum Architecture offers a nuanced and realistic answer:

> The domain does not *know* the context,  
> but it is **aware of its uncertainty** about it.  
> And it is precisely **this uncertainty** that defines the **interface** between the two.

The domain therefore establishes a **clear and abstract interface** to **receive intentions** and **produce effects**,  
without knowing **who, how**, or **from where** those intentions originate.

> It does not treat context as total ignorance,  
> but as a **zone of controlled, encapsulated, contractual uncertainty.**

**The Functional Dimension of the Domain**

This interface is what Continuum Architecture calls the ***functional dimension*****:**

A clear, explicit layer that includes:

- The **features exposed** by the domain
- The **internal services** of the domain
- The **input and output contracts** through which it interacts with context

This dimension enables the domain:

- To **preserve its autonomy**
- To **accept uncertainty** as a structuring principle
- And to **remain operational** across multiple contexts

**A Humble, Yet Powerful Domain**

We do not emphasize the domain because it has lost its value—  
but because most of **the abstraction work has already been done there.**

The real imbalance today lies elsewhere:

- We have often **overdefined the domain**,
- And **ignored the context**,
- Or **left the connection between the two to implicit implementations.**

Continuum Architecture **does not replace the work accomplished on the domain**—  
it **reintegrates it into a relational dynamic,**  
and gives it **a structured, orchestrated, coherent** environment in which to express itself.

## 5\. The Continuum — Domain and Context Are Inseparable

At the heart of every application lies neither the domain nor the context.  
It is the living relationship that unites them.  
A bond of mutual dependence, constant adjustment, and resonance.

This relationship is what Continuum Architecture places at the center of all software design: a continuum.

The domain cannot function without a context to carry it.  
The context only takes shape because a domain comes to inhabit it.  
One is meaning, the other is situation. Together, they form the application.

**Intention: The Expressed Form of Need**

Every application begins with an intention.  
Intention is the desire of an actor to produce an effect, to fulfill a need, to trigger an action.  
It is carried by the external context and takes the form of a cause: an event, a request, an interaction, a command.

Intention does not address the domain directly.  
It traverses context, passes through an adapter, and becomes intelligible to the application.

In Continuum Architecture, intention is normalized by the integration dimension, then passed to the initialization dimension, which activates the domain at the right moment, according to the rules defined in the blueprint.

**Clear Causality: Cause → Effect**

There is only one relationship between the external context and the application system:

**Cause → Effect**  
An expressed intention provokes a reaction from the domain, translated into a response.

But this causality must not create dependency.  
The domain does not observe the cause directly.  
It responds to its abstraction, orchestrated by the adapter.  
This is the full power of the **principle of contextual uncertainty**.

**The Principle of Contextual Uncertainty**

This principle states that:

> The domain cannot, at the same time, know its execution context precisely and remain independent from it.

If it knows the context too precisely, it becomes coupled to it—rigid, non-reusable.  
If it ignores it completely, it fails to respond to intentions.  
The solution: abstraction, mediation, deliberate uncertainty—managed by the system.

**Context as Superposition**

From the application’s perspective, the external context exists in a state of superposition.  
All platforms, requests, input sources exist as potential—until the application executes its logic.  
It is at runtime, within the integration dimension, that intention collapses, is normalized, stabilized, and becomes usable internal context.

This **contextual collapse**—this decoherence—is the meeting point between raw reality and logical system.

**Context Is Relative, Not Absolute**

Context never exists "in itself."  
It is always perceived from a point of view: that of the application.

Context is relative to a referential, just as reality is to the observer.

This is why internal context is necessary:  
It forms that stable referential, within which intentions can be understood and logic activated.

**Independent in Design, Inseparable in Execution**

Domain and context can—and must—be designed independently.  
They belong to different disciplines, lifecycles, and responsibilities.

But they can only exist *in act* through their encounter.  
It is this encounter, orchestrated in a given moment, that gives birth to the application.

The application is not a fixed object.  
It is an event, a point of interaction, a moment of convergence.

In this light, domain and context form a continuum, like space and time.  
Independent in theory, inseparable in reality.  
Their interaction produces something new:

A dynamic, a realized intention, a living digital reality.

It is in this point of junction, this conscious orchestration of their interaction, that the true role of architecture resides.

To design an application is to design an event in the continuum.  
And architecture is its gravitational field.

**The Four Fundamental Dimensions of the Continuum**

Ultimately, Continuum Architecture rests upon four fundamental dimensions:

- Three contextual: **setup**, **integration**, **initialization** — which model the structure of the internal context and orchestrate the encounter with the external;
- One functional: which hosts the domain, its services, and its interface of operation.

The domain is therefore a dimension in its own right, but we choose not to make it the central focus, as existing architectures (DDD, Clean Architecture, Hexagonal, etc.) have already explored it extensively.  
Our attention turns instead to the **orchestration of the domain within the context**—for this is where the true blind spot of contemporary software architecture lies.

**A Mathematical Note**

In mathematical terms, we can view an application as a **Cartesian product**:

> `Application = Domain × Context`

This product represents not just a set of components, but an **ordered pair (context, domain)** whose interaction produces a result.

In that sense, when some say *"this application is a product"*, they are more accurate than they think:  
It truly is — a dynamic product between a structured knowledge (domain) and a real-world situation (context), producing resolution.

## 6\. Founding Principles of Continuum Architecture

Continuum Architecture is based on a simple observation:

An application is the act of applying a domain to a context in order to solve a problem.

From this vision arises a new way of thinking about software architecture, founded on the conscious orchestration of domain and context.

Here are its founding principles:

- **Domain and context are modeled separately, but designed to meet.**  
The domain is autonomous, the context is open, and their point of contact is orchestrated. One is not subordinate to the other.
- **The application is born from an event: the meeting of domain and context.**  
It is not an object, but a phenomenon. It exists when an intention is expressed within a context and activates business logic.
- **Intention is the starting point of all execution.**  
It is the expressed form of need, transmitted by the external context, captured and normalized by an adapter.
- **The domain is a functional dimension, but not the sole priority.**  
Continuum Architecture recognizes the richness of domain-oriented architectures, but shifts the focus to the dynamic orchestration of the domain within a given context.  
It is not the domain that makes the application, but the way it is applied.
- **The domain remains uncertain about the context, but not ignorant.**  
It is this controlled uncertainty that allows it to evolve freely while being ready to execute when an intention passes through the context.
- **External context is endured, internal context is structured.**  
The former is chaotic, multiform, unpredictable. The latter is stable, coherent, and guided by the architecture.
- **The adapter is the application’s consciousness.**  
It transforms raw causes into intelligible intentions. It connects two worlds without conflating them.
- **Internal context is structured along three dimensions: setup, integration, initialization.**  
Each plays a specific role in staging the application and enabling its activation.
- **Causality between context and domain is mediated, never direct.**  
The domain never receives a raw request: it responds to an orchestrated intention.
- **The application is relative to a referential.**  
Context is perceived from a point of view. Software is an observer: it organizes reality from within its own interpretive framework.
- **To design an architecture is to orchestrate an interaction.**  
Not to stack blocks. Not to choose layers. But to organize the space of an encounter, in all its dimensions: technical, human, economic, temporal.  
And ultimately, it is the architecture—not the domain—that must manage the tension between raw reality and business logic. This includes creating the internal context, normalizing inputs, and ensuring coherence in interactions.
- **Time is a dimension of architecture.**  
Context changes. Intentions evolve.  
Architecture must be conceived not only in space (components, layers), but also in time: lifecycle, synchronization, dynamic instantiation.

## 7\. Call to Action — A New Culture of Software

Continuum Architecture is not a method.  
It is not a rigid framework, nor a plug-and-play tool.  
It is a shift in perspective, a shift in stance, a shift in culture.

It invites us to design software not as a stack of layers, but as a space of interaction between a domain and a context.  
Not as a closed solution, but as an orchestrated encounter.  
Not as isolated code, but as a living, situated, intentional act.

We therefore call:

- **Developers** to model context with as much care as the domain.
- **Architects** to organize software around intentions and points of convergence.
- **Educators** to teach the distinction between external and internal context.
- **Framework designers** to make the dimensions of context explicit.
- **Teams** to question their models, their tools, their habits.
- And the **entire industry** to restore context to its rightful place: at the center.

If you’re creating a CLI, a backend, a mobile app, a microservice, or an open-source framework...  
If you’re deploying AI models, serverless architectures, event-driven systems, or cloud-native infrastructures...  
Then you are directly concerned by the question of context.  
And you have the power to transform how you architect software.

This manifesto is the theory.  
**Stone.js** is its tangible embodiment.  
It is an open-source framework, designed from the ground up to embody every principle of the continuum:

- **Adapters aware of context**
- **Pipelines of intentional execution**
- **Strict separation of domain, external context, and internal context**
- **Dynamic behavior through blueprinting, injection, orchestration**

Concrete applications have already been built with Stone.js, including:

- **Dynamic CLIs** capable of adapting to various execution environments
- **Universal backends** deployable on Node, AWS Lambda, or edge functions without changing business code
- **Frontend applications** using the same domain across web, mobile, or serverless contexts
- **Educational demos** showcasing the power of intentional decoupling and contextual modeling

This is not about adding a layer of complexity.  
It’s about seeing more clearly what has always been there:

**Software is the art of executing intention within a context.**
